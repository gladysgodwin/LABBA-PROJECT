          <h1><strong>Who is a Laboratory Scientist?</strong></h1>
          <article>
            <p>
              A medical laboratory scientist (MLS), also known as a medical
              technologist or clinical laboratory scientist, works to analyze a
              variety of biological specimens. They are responsible for
              performing scientific testing on samples and reporting results to
              physicians.
              <br />
              Medical laboratory scientists perform complex tests on patient
              samples using sophisticated equipment like microscopes. The data
              they find plays an important role in identifying and treating
              cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and other medical conditions. It
              is estimated 60 to 70 percent of all decisions regarding a
              patient's diagnosis, treatment, hospital admission, and discharge
              are based on the results of the tests medical laboratory
              scientists perform.

          <strong>Who is a Laboratory Technician and Phlebotomist?</strong>
        </h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            Laboratory technicians perform a variety of tasks in clinical and
            medical settings ranging from drawing blood to performing lab tests.
            <br />
            Laboratory technicians collect samples of body fluids and tissues
            and perform clinical tests analyzing these samples. These tests are
            usually of a simpler nature than those performed by laboratory
            technologists or scientists, who have more advanced training and
            often oversee and instruct technicians.They are responsible for
            maintaining and sterilizing equipment.
            <br />
            Some specialties exist within the laboratory technology field.
            Phlebotomists, for example, are primarily concerned with the
            collection of the blood samples used for laboratory tests, blood
            donations and transfusion procedures. Histotechnicians, another
            specialty of laboratory technicians, are responsible for preparing
            the microscopic slides of tissue specimens that pathologists use to
            make their diagnoses.
